                Having just earned my bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and
                completed a Full-Stack program at Columbia University, I am now
                looking for full-time opportunities as a Full-Stack Developer. I
                have demonstrated proficiency in the development of applications
                using various programming languages such as C++, Java, and
                JavaScript. I have also gained a strong understanding of various
                web-technologies, front-end development tools, back-end
                development tools, middle-ware technology and database systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                On my path, I have found an increasing affinity to spend more
                time honing my skills as a Full-Stack Programmer. Hence, the
                decision to pursue a career as one. My past experience
                developing Full-Stack applications has shown me the way Database
                Systems, Client-Server paradigms, Client-Server technologies,
                and middle-ware technology work together in harmony to create
                complex, usable software.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                I am in search of an opportunity that will consistently
                challenge me and my abilities as a developer, an opportunity
                that surrounds me with motivated, inspired individuals, and an
                opportunity that cultivates an environment that encourages its
                employees to learn, listen, innovate and grow together.
